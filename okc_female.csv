There have been times that it was hard, but I guess nailing the toughest parts are also the most rewarding.  So I guess because I chose the musician route, I've never really been athletically gifted and trust me...im always that kid that doesnt know how to pass the ball in PE. So obviously, I never really liked to exercise and probably even hated the thought of it. But sometime last year, I discovered spinning, and I realised that it wasnt that I hated exercise or I was not good at it, I just didnt find an activity that was suitable for me and that I really liked. And because of this mini discovery, I've moved on to more activities now. Yay to healthy living!  I wanted to be a musician when I was much younger, but my mom was rly worried about that choice and wanted me to go to uni, so here I am taking 20aus in my 3rd year. Hopefully I'll get to go for a grad trip by the time I graduate since I couldn't go for an exchange this year.

6332,Alexia,27,"Update (September 2021): Haven't got time to always keep my profile up to date. Some responses to questions below might not be the most current, but most should still be accurate. Just drop me an intro if you want to find out on any specifics. ___________________________________________________ Introverted, old soul, basic, geeky, low maintenance, easy going but socially awkward and takes some time to open up. I'm really bad at initiating and holding conversations especially if they're superficial small talks. Can be both affectionate and/or dominant (read: having my own ideas, aspirations and plans) with the right person. Confident in my own ways and also very adventurous.  Not afraid to get my hands dirty when it comes to work (quite a workaholic) or things that I'm passionate about. Nothing against make-up but really just the kind of girl that would prefer going bare-faced or with minimal make-up.  Captivated by European cities after spending one semester in Switzerland (and also failing to pick up German miserably). That said, down to relocate if I meet the right person.  If it matters, I'm an INFJ-T and a true blue Scorpio. Deep meaningful relationships, conversations are what gets me going :)  Not looking for anything non-serious; looking for genuine connection - friendship and/or romance. Relatively traditional when it comes to romance, you'll probably find out more as you get to know me.  Note: I really do read through every profile in detail but I don't expect anyone else to do the same. If you really want to catch my attention, send a message that isn't just ""Hi"" or ""Hello"".",True,True,True,False

I‘d like to get to know people, be friends, and maybe if I’m lucky, find a life partner.  Now, about me. I‘m an introvert, that means socializing in larger group, even if it just small talks, consumes a lot of my energy. But it doesn’t mean I hate it, I just prefer one on one when it comes to getting to know someone. And despite being an introvert, I can be really chatty.  People around me would describe me as creative and a nerd. I work in a small design studio with a group of lovely weirdos, who are kind enough to always listen to my random trivia that I got from watching documentaries or reading articles. Things like history, science, and crime interest me.  I‘m not a sporty person, but I try to work out everyday. I like to watch movies and series, usually sci-fi, comedy, mysteries, action. I listen to music a lot of time although my playlist might bore you cause I’m the type that would play my fav song over and over and over again.  If you chat with me, you‘ll definitely going to get fair amount of emojis and gifs. I‘m find with any topics, but I may not have the knowledge of the topic is outside my area of interest, so be sure to tell me all about it.",True,True,True,False

I am from Singapore, and am back for good (I think), having completed my undergraduate law degree and LLM in the UK.  I indulge in travelling and spontaneous trips to get away from my crazy busy boring life. Would love to be part of an orchestra someday, maybe for a musical in one of the theaters in London.  I am a hopeless romantic. I am a musical and theatre junkie. I am a classically trained closet pianist, and an introvert who is overly self-aware, talks too much sometimes and is selectively social. I am a procrastinator with a perfectionist streak. I am not pretty, and I love hiding in a crowd. I have a penchant for blazers, shift dresses, brogues and costume jewellery. I like making people happy through gift-giving, writing cards (because somehow I don't know how to pay a compliment verbally) and with my weird sense of humour. I am highly sensitive to other people's needs, constantly putting others before myself, and I keep my loved ones close to me. I used to swim and play tennis, but I gave them up to focus on my studies. I believe in and enjoy giving back to society by devoting my time towards volunteer work as I grew up in a very loving and God-fearing family where I was blessed with a somewhat privileged upbringing, and would be interested in going on mission trips in the future if time permits. I love to people watch, as if I am a ghost noticing the existence and little idiosyncrasies of the people walking by, occasionally listening in on the conversations surrounding me to remind myself I am alive, but still intentional in my displacement from the rest of the world, attempting to pry into the lives of others but only briefly and from afar. I like taking random photographs, although I abhor being photographed, and I love visiting museums and art galleries, and taking long walks with no particular destination. I am a klutz, and I don't know how to be precise or organize my thoughts :( and either I am evidently terrible at self-summaries, or there is just so much to me that it warrants this ridiculously long paragraph of weird words.  I am a flawed and weak individual, but I am a child of God, and am in a constant process of learning and self-discovery. I would not have gotten to where I am today if not for Him, and I am forever indebted to Him, for His unconditional and unwavering love and for showing me mercy, even when I have not been consistent and constantly drift away, and for the times when I felt alone and thought no one cared.
